# GW-BASIC Examples

This directory contains example BASIC programs that can be used to test and demonstrate the GW-BASIC interpreter functionality.

## Files

- `sample.bas` - Original sample program included with the project
- `test.bas` - Simple test program with FOR-NEXT loop and PRINT statements
- `test_for_loop.bas` - Comprehensive FOR-NEXT loop test including nested loops and STEP
- `output.bas` - Example program generated by the SAVE command

## Usage

Load any of these programs using the LOAD command:

```basic
LOAD "examples/test.bas"
RUN
```

Or if running from the examples directory:

```basic
LOAD "test.bas"
RUN
```

## Creating New Examples

When creating new example programs:

1. Use meaningful line numbers (10, 20, 30, etc.)
2. Include comments using REM statements
3. Test basic functionality like:
   - Variable assignment and arithmetic
   - FOR-NEXT loops
   - IF-THEN conditionals
   - PRINT statements with various formats
   - String operations
